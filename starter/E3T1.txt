GuardDuty is analyzing events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail event logs, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) flow Logs, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) audit logs, and DNS query logs. The bruteforce attack might have been detected by anaylizing the VPC flow logs.

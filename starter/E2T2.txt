    - Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports
    - Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
    - The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic
    - Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at-rest
    - EBS default encryption should be enabled
    - EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
    - EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
    - Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    - Application load balancer should be configured to drop http headers
    - Application and Classic Load Balancers logging should be enabled
    - Application Load Balancer deletion protection should be enabled
    - IAM customer managed policies that you create should not allow wildcard actions for services
    - S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled
    - S3 buckets should have event notifications enabled
    - S3 buckets should have lifecycle policies configured
    - S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
    - S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer

AWS Inspector
    - Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance i-0471f2117f3f2ae18 in your assessment target.
    - Instance i-0471f2117f3f2ae18 is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
    - Instance i-0471f2117f3f2ae18 is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.
    - On instance i-0471f2117f3f2ae18, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet
    - On instance i-0471f2117f3f2ae18, process 'systemd-netwo' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet
    - No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on instance i-0471f2117f3f2ae18 in your assessment target. This allows users to set simple passwords, thereby increasing the chances of unauthorized users gaining access and misusing accounts.
    - On instance i-0471f2117f3f2ae18, process 'python3' is listening on TCP port 5000 which is reachable from the internet

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
